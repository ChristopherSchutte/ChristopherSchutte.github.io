<h1 class="title">The Bachelor and the Gender Pay Gap</h1>
<div id="padding">
<p class="paragraph">It's <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Fjel.20160995&source=post_page---------------------------">widely known</a> that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00256.x?casa_token=bi8kWSdFNZEAAAAA%3ATSU--MzfK6rmVKpLtrXqhZ408loSKWJhdqYWlPKlIN2Fq6XZH-CYqmyX_ko5bNamEPONcuAHux5o7WRk">there is a gap</a> 
    in the <a href ="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/03/24/482141/quick-facts-gender-wage-gap/">mean income between men and women</a>. 
    <a href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/simple-truth/">This gap</a> has been found 
    to be the result of a complex series of factors, the specifics of which are not the focus of this peice. 
    Rather, this document accepts the validity of the gener pay gap and examines the top 20 occupations 
    from male and female contestants on the Bachelorette and the Bachelor to see if even a simple 
    aggrigation of the Department of Labor's wage statistics and these occupations can illustrate this devide.
</p>

<br>

<p class="header">For this analysis, I used these databases:</p>
<ul class="paragraph">
    <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelorette-contestants#__sid=js0">The Bachelor & Bechelorette Contestants Dataset on Kaggle</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm">The Bureau of Labor Statistics May 2019 national Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates</a></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p class="paragraph">Using these databases I was able to aggrigate the occupational data of the contestants separated by gender. 
    Then I isolated the top 20 occupations and used the BLS's database to match these occupations with their mean yearly income. 
    From that point I was able to create these two visualizations where the annual mean salaries are compared to 
    the number of contestants with said salary/occupation:
</p>

<br>

<div class="image">
    <h2>Male Contestants</h2>

</div>

<br>

<div class="image">
    <h2>Female Contestants</h2>
    <img src="femaleContestants.png" alt="Male Contestant Chart">
</div>

<br>

<p class="paragraph">After this initial batch of visualizations I pulled the dataframes back into Excel 
    for some simple analysis. After multiplying each salary by the number of contestants with said salary, 
    every salary was added to a total along with the total contestants from the table. Then the salary 
    total was devided by the number of participants to find an average salary for said gender. The results 
    of this analysis were also telling:
</p>

<br>

<ul class="paragraph">
    <li>The average salary for the top 20 most common occupations among male contestants was: <strong>$89,748.33</strong></li>
    <li>The average salary for the top 20 most common occupations among female contestants was: <strong>$56,662.98</strong></li>
    <li><Strong>This created a difference of: 36.86%</Strong></li>
</ul>

<br>

<p class="paragraph">With this data the message is clear, even the bachelor can't escape the systematic 
    opressions of our current systems and in addition to this conclusion, the percent difference of this 
    show's participants is worse then the aggriated paygap commonly sited in studies, the cause for which would have to 
    be the product of more extensive analysis.
