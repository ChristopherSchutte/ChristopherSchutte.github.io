        <h1> Wall Street Bets is a Scam</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>There's a narrative going around</strong> that what Wall Street Bets is doing is 
             <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/gamestop-wall-street-bets.html">the little guy standing up to the big guy</a>
            , that this resembles a sucessful hit against some of the most powerful actors in the world. But there is a 
            <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/the-gamestop-bubble-is-going-to-hurt-a-lot-of-ordinary-investors/">dark truth</a> 
            to <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/reddit-conspiracy-gamestop-wall-street-bets-citadel/">what's happening on WSB</a>, 
            and it has nothing to do with any literal new age Robin Hood. But to prove it, data scientists like us are going to have to dig through a lot of 
            data, and here's how we could do it:<br><br>
            
            When WSB began to gain in popularity at the beginning of the short squeeze on GME, 
            the moderation team has alleged they were kicked out by the, up to that point, inactive 
            original mod team. With interviews and qualitative analysis using tools like:
            <ul>
                <li>VADER - to measure general sentiments</li>
                <li>Web scraping - to pull posts </li>
                <li>And qualitative analysis of potential interviews</li>
            </ul>
            We could show how this moderation team changed the subreddit, and when it appears they lost power.
            This could both analyze the biases of the new and old mods, but would also varify
            claims made by mods in interviews and in comments.<br><br>

            The next phase would be to show who made money during the rise of GME. This would be done
            with similar analysis of people who in the future may admit to investing in GME during 
            this event, and then using that survey data determine how many made money and how many lost.<br><br>

            If possible (which I'm not even sure it is) there a ton of now banned users of WSB that 
            allege that WSB is deleting posts talking about losses, and banning people who consistantly
            contribute to the sub in this way. Which if proved through some kind of advanced web tracing,
            could prove if they were deleting posts and further reinforce conclusions found in the 
            prevouis methods.<br><br>

            Lastly these findings could be used to influence SEC policies that are woefully outdated
            for the digital age. They could also conduct investigations to look into whether 
            large investment firms and wealthy individuals manipulated the users on WSB by using the subreddit
            to pump and dump dead stocks with a guaranteed payday by outsmarting their competing hedge funds 
            by taking advantage of a desperate subreddit to squeeze their initially successful shorts. Meaning 
            the architects and the main victors of GMEs rise were entrenched actors and wealthy day, traders 
            which in turn will most likely steal a few more billion from millions of users desperate for some
            semblance of a payout in an increasingly desperate and hollow economy that keeps you so close to the 
            life and debt line that you have no choice to internalize these unjustifiable and oppressive 
            hierarchies and try to gamble what little you're allowed to have on a potential meme payday. 
            This absolutely highlighted how these systems and rules are set up and who really calls the 
            shots, but instead of the bad guys being Robin Hood forcing users to sell based on the margin
            trading agreement you certify before you are lent shares. The bad guys are the same people 
            WSB thinks they took down, and the only people that will hurt are the millions who couldn't afford
            to lose a thousand.<br><br>
